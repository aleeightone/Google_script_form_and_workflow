This is a form and workflow builder that can be deployed against Google Docs.  
It is meant to be used primarily with corporate Gmail accounts, but anyone with a gmail account can use it.
It is made to simulate any of the BPM tools corporations use, but which are such a pain in the ass to modify or deploy.
It requires a Google Spreadsheet that can be found at the URL below.  You'll need to make a copy and deploy the scripts yourself - I'll try to add some guides later.
